## Introduction

The internet allows information sharing and communication globally, but it also exposes users to surveillance, data tracking, and privacy risks. Tor (The Onion Router) is a free, open-source system designed to improve privacy and anonymity online. It hides the user’s identity and location by routing traffic through multiple volunteer servers (nodes) before reaching its destination.
## **. What Is Tor?**

Tor is both:

- A **network** — a group of servers (called relays) that anonymize internet traffic.
- A **browser** — a modified version of Firefox that connects users to the Tor network easily.

When you use Tor Browser, your internet connection is encrypted and passes through at least three random nodes:

1. **Entry Node** – first server that receives your traffic.
2. **Middle Relay** – passes encrypted data without knowing the source or destination.
3. **Exit Node** – final relay that sends the traffic to the target website.

Each relay only knows the previous and next relay, not the entire path. This layered encryption is like “peeling an onion,” which inspired the name **The Onion Router**.
## **Purpose of Tor**

Tor is mainly used for:

- Protecting **online privacy** and **anonymity**.
- Avoiding **censorship** and accessing blocked websites.
- Enabling **secure communication** for journalists, activists, and researchers.
- Providing access to **.onion websites** on the dark web.
- How Tor Enhances Security

Encryption: Data is encrypted multiple times before being sent, protecting it from network monitoring.

Anonymity: IP address and location are hidden from websites and trackers.

Decentralization: Thousands of volunteer-run relays make it hard to control or trace users.

No logging: Tor does not store browsing history or tracking cookies by default.
## **Advantages of Tor**

| **Advantages** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Anonymity** | Hides user IP and location. |
| **Privacy** | Prevents tracking by ISPs, advertisers, and governments. |
| **Free and Open Source** | Anyone can use or audit it. |
| **Bypasses Censorship** | Access restricted or blocked websites. |
## **Limitations and Risks**

| **Limitations** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Slower Speed** | Multi-node routing reduces browsing speed. |
| **Exit Node Monitoring** | Traffic leaving Tor may be visible if not encrypted (avoid logins or sensitive data). |
| **Illegal Use** | Some use Tor for dark web crimes — using Tor itself is legal, but illegal activities are not. |
| **Website Blocking** | Some sites block access from Tor exit nodes. |
## **Legal and Ethical Use**

Tor itself is **legal** in most countries. However, using it for illegal purposes (e.g., buying stolen data or malware services) is against the law. Ethical cybersecurity practice focuses on privacy protection, research, and testing within legal boundaries.
